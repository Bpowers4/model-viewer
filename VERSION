    Rendering refactor for anti-aliasing (#880)
    
    * removed normalmap blur
    
    * added roughnessmipmapper
    
    * need to change strategies
    
    * roughness shader runs
    
    * changing roughness mips, but not saving the texture properly
    
    * texture saving working, but seems to have a race condition
    
    * commented out debugging
    
    * roughness mipmapper sort of working but may have a race
    
    * working better now; equation needs work
    
    * mipmapping and saving work, equation should be tweaked
    
    * merging master
    
    * roughness mipmapper working
    
    * cleanup
    
    * added vertex normal antialiasing
    
    * fixed skybox
    
    * disaligned blur axes to remove pole artifact
    
    * added uniform mip level
    
    * moved geometry antialiasing up to affect main roughness value
    
    * using two roughness values
    
    * moved debugging function
    
    * fixed black PMREM corner pixels
    
    * added directional light fidelity test
    
    * remapped roughness
    
    * best yet
    
    * first cleanup
    
    * second cleanup
    
    * more cleanup
    
    * fixed unlit model bug
    
    * reverting index
    
    * bumped threejs version
    
    * cleanup
    
    * cleaning spaces
    
    * added docs, shader improvement
    
    * updated goldens
    
    * slight update of PMREM parameters to match analysis
    
    * updated goldens
    
    * addressing feedback
    
    * renderer -> threeRenderer
    
    * moved debug to utilities
    
    * added comma
